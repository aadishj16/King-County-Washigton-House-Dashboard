A project on the King County house dataset, uncovering intriguing insights into the local housing market! 📊✨
With a meticulously curated dataset, I've analyzed the distribution of house prices, bathrooms, bedrooms, daily average prices, views, and house conditions. 📈💰🛁🛏️
But that's just the tip of the iceberg! 🗺️📍 I've also designed an interactive map that visually represents housing prices across different areas of Washington, offering valuable location-based perspectives.
